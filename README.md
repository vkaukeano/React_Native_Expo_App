This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

I have began creating a template that uses firebase authentication for logging in.
Also react-navigation is used to navigate between the screens. 

If anyone has any recommendations to clean up, a better way, or anything to help me understand better please do not hesitate.
